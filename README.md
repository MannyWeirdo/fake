# fake
Fake is a custom interface testing tool for Mianqian company.
Fake powered by node,koa2,mongo......
If you wanna get this shit working.
First,you need install mongo on your local env ,listen to 27017 port and create a database named fakedb.
Second,since i used ES6 stuff to build this, you need run app.js with '--harmony' parameters.
Third,dont ask me why i dont use postman, i use postman and i have no fucking choise to create this shit.
